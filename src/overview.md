# Overview

At Overengineered we want to enable developers to create [decentralized]()
software. Software that is [secure](), [private](), and [portable]().

Developers should be able to create tools and utilities that can be shared
through social media or a URL. All required programs, services, and software
dependencies will be installed to your own personal cloud with a click of a
button.

Your cloud is private and secure. Your data is treated as first class, you can
choose to share it with friends, family, co-workers, any community clouds, or
share it with the world.

## Developer Vision

We want to create a platform, series of tools, and software libraries to enable
developers to focus on engineering solutions to problems. Less time on dev-ops
or the logistics of dealing with the hardware infrastructure.

Our approach to [Web 3.0]() is bringing the cloud infrastructure to the home
and create an interconnected [data graph]().

By making installation as easy installing a windows
operating system, and each subsequent install as easy as scanning a QR code
with a mobile or [AR]() app.

Application dependencies and requirements will be included in the app metadata.
This allows the containers to be built in the private cloud in a
[secure sandboxed]() environnement.

The metadata includes any database requirements in the form of a
[Graph Schema](). This will describe the type of datastore typed fields,
[security](), and [privacy settings]().

Graph Schemas are stored hosted in [decentralized repositories]() that the app
users can subscribe to. This allows us to create a global data graph of
information. Additional tools are provided to easily [create]() and [share]()
