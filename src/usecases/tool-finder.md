# Tool Finder

## User Story

Our garage has a large number of tools and fasteners that we have purchased or
inherited. We have large storage cabinets with hundreds of screws and bolts of
various sizes, it's often a pain to find what I'm looking for. Putting my tools
away is another story. No one seems to know where anything goes.

## Features

Track [inventory]() of all tools and fasteners. Everything is a [location]()
where items can reside in.

All items in the garage or house should have an [assigned location]() or home.

Can use a voice assistant to ask if we have any [in stock](), where the
location is suppose to be, or to place an order.

Use [cameras]() to track which locations are 'touched' to trigger a [task]()
to perform inventory on that location. Use of [robotics]() can automatically
perform a count.

A system for checking out tools automatically so they can be tracked when they
leave the garage.

Automatic [assignment]() or [consumption]() of anything that is taken from
the garage.
