# Social Features

## User Story

Personally I do not use many social media features for their primary purpose.
I'll only gravitate toward them if it serves some objectively measurable
outcome and it's topic specific.

Social media companies goals are tied to company revenue. Which will create a
competitive environnement to fight over how much time is spent. Look to
optimize for whatever drives time spent per dollar. I'd rather goal against
reducing time spent on app, while providing the most productivity.

## Features

Every [Node]() in the [Graph]() is able to have [Msg]() left on it.

[Channels](), any of the [official]() or [user defined](), are utilized to
direct the conversation in a meaningful way. Such as [pro tip](),
[accessibility]() (feedback), [localization]() (feedback) etc.

Msg(s) will be [consolidated]() and [filterable]() in a single view. Allowing
to see Msgs from public channels as well as personal, household, family, friend,
or [locally community managed]() at once.

Channels can be viewed and independent of the node it's tided to.

[Plugins]() can be created by the community and enabled to create "reactions".
Officially we will have more productive Plugins enabled by default.

- Provide [ranking feedback]() for sorting the content you'd prefer to see
  instead of feedback about the object itself or it's creator.

Built in support for attaching a [source]() to a part of a message. Messages
with sources will have a higher [priority]() and will be sorted by default:
priority | [time created]().

Priority can be increased further with a [verified source]() or a known group
of [experts]()[^note] confirms the source. The verification will start in a pending
state and will move through a number of experts relative to the community size.
This all happens within the graph the message was sent in.

[^note]:
    Experts are verified through a decentralized user account that is
    known to be an expert in the respective field.
