# Smart Home Automation

## User Story

I'd like lighting to be turn on and off based on occupancy.

People are tracked via cameras throughout the house. It would be nice to
keep preferences as people move in and out of rooms. Doors lock / unlock
automatically. Interaction with smart speakers can be initiated without wake
word if eye contact is made with a camera.

I'd like the cameras to integrate with other systems projects, such as
generating a [todo]() to take the trash out when it looks full. Load the
dishwasher when dishes are on the counter, things get left out etc. This will
also help with responsibility. I'd like to get charts and data on who doesn't
pick up after themselves and estimate how much time they are costing other
people who clean up after them.

Magnetocaloric heat pump, geo thermal, floor and air heating zones in every
room in the house. Add refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, washer, dryer, faucets?

I'd like to have a smart induction stove. The entire surface is usable, no
dedicated burners. Will adjust size of burner, and uses a camera to detect
where the pot is and display it on a touch display. Can select virtual burners
and set exact temperatures instead of low-high.
