# Robotics

## User Story

Since we have all the data from the other projects, it would be nice to have
some robots that can start to automate [tasks]().

If someone doesn't take care of their dishes and leave them out. A robot should
be able to place it in the sink or dishwasher.

Automatically maintain the 3D prints or other CNC machines.

Automatically [inventory]() [locations]() where a person was [seen]() touching
or around a location.

When I have a new [CAD design]() for something I'll be building in the shop,
automatically pull the tools, parts, lumber etc. so it is ready to go.
