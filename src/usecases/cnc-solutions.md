# CNC Solutions

## User Story

Currently a lot of CNC is out of the hands of most people and requires specific
skill sets and a lot of time dedicated to the machine. We can look at the layer
lines and know how our printer is performing and what we need to do to fine
tune it. In a mill, cutter, or router we need to center and secure our parts
properly in order to get something that fits within tolerance. These are easily
automatable task through the combination of vision, laser, and electronic edge
finders.

Would also be nice to see integration with the CAD design as well, let's say
design kitchen cabinets and the cut list is automatically sent to a CNC
table saw, where the blade, height, angle, and fence are set automatically. I'd
just hit next, next, next, interact through an interface. If I needed I could
back out into full controls.
